## Quick start

 - 1.Run a backend app
 - 2.Specify a proxy port to acces backend from frontend application via ./frontend/package.json (in my case it's :44317)

## Notes
I'm sorry if you are a little bit confused about some files in this project. 
This projects was started via templates that I use usually for my own projects. So, some code (like Authorization or something else) is here for historical reasons.
