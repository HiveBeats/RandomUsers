## Quick start

 - 1.Run a backend app as you like (via IDE or just from CLI)
 - 2.Specify a proxy port to acces backend from frontend application via ./frontend/package.json (in my case it's :44317)
 - 3.Run 'npm install' and then 'npm run start' to run a frontend project

## Notes
I'm sorry if you are a little bit confused about some files in this project. 
This projects was started via templates that I usually use for my own projects. So, some code (like Authorization or something else) is here for historical reasons.
